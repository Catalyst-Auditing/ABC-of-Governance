**What are first principles ?**
{% endhint %}

The First Principles approach seeks to encourage you to "Think for yourself".

Rooted in the Socratric method of Ancient Classical Philosophy the First Principles approach has been advocated more recently by Richard Feynman (see the [Feynman Principles](https://blog.dtssydney.com/richard-feynmans-principles-of-scientific-thinking)) and Elon Musk ([The First Principles Method Explained by Elon Musk)](https://youtu.be/NV3sBlRgzTI).
