# Agency Theory & "Skin in the game"

## Skin in the game

The phrase "Skin in the game" originated in the 1980s and referred to the amount of an investment owned by a companies' management soliciting outside investment.&#x20;

The more that was owned by management, the equity stake, was seen as an indication of confidence or stability in the investment. A sign that the management were personally invested and therefore had "skin in the game".

## The phrase "Skin in the game"

Hence the phrase "skin in the game" has come to be seen as having a stake or personal investment that motivates decision making or participation.&#x20;

## Principal–agent problem

"Skin in the game" can be a problem when there is an excess of interest or investment that prejudices participation and/or decision-making. This tendency is called the "principal-agent problem".

The influence of those who have a large stake may be obscured resulting in a lack of transparency that disadvantages or manipulates those with smaller stakes.&#x20;

The principal-agent relationship may be between management (agent) and shareholders (principal), or elected officials (agent) and voters (principal), or brokers (agent) and buyers/sellers in a market (principal).

Where there is an asymmetry between agent and principal there will be concerns about moral hazard (exposure to risk) and conflict of interest (corruption).

## Blockchain agency theory <a href="#screen-reader-main-title" id="screen-reader-main-title"></a>

In the context of blockchain technologies the question arises of what is the nature of the principal-agent relationship in permissioned and/or permissionless chains.&#x20;

### Where is Agency in a Blockchain environment ?

Where is agency in an environment that is ideally decentralized ?  Are there still parties (principal) who delegate work to others (agents) ?&#x20;

Governance takes the form of consensus algorithms that ideally regulate blockchain transactions. This permissionless state seeks to dispense with the agent-principal dependency.

Participation in a blockchain ecosystem can be characterized as a kind of strategic alliance between software developers, miners, stakepools, coin holders and other stakeholders that build tools and communities on the infrastructure.

Blockchain agency theory, as outlined in a recent paper, seeks to identify shifts in the principal-agent problem caused by disruptive technologies.&#x20;

## What principal–agent relationships have changed ?

The "Blockchain agency theory" paper identifies 7 assumptions that have informed analysis of the principal-agent problem and pairs these with 7 counter assumptions that may apply to the new blockchain paradigm.&#x20;

Rather than the principal-agent relationship, the interactions in blockchain alliances take a many-to-many dimension and an ecosystem dynamic to co-evolve and co-create value in a mutual sequence.

### 1 - Self-interest / Common Interests

The first assumption of Agency theory is that of self-interest. That agents are inclined to opportunistically reward themselves.&#x20;

Ideally a blockchain will moderate the self-interest of agents seeking to control principal participants. As long as the chain is sufficiently decentralized the common interest of an operational distributed ledger will prevail.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The self-interest of both parties is mitigated by an alignment of incentives and interests.
{% endhint %}

### 2 - Conflicting goals / Congruent goals

The second agency theory assumption is that principals and agents have divergent objectives. For example, agents will seek to maximize their income from their specialized capability and principals seek to maximize their return using the agents capability. These divergent objectives can lead to a reduction in effort by the agent seeking to maximize their income and consequently less return for the principals.&#x20;

Blockchains seek to reconcile these conflicting goals when governance rules are defined in the blockchain design. Members of a blockchain community ideally determine and agree governance of how data and transactions are represented and disputes resolved onchain. This is often framed in terms of common objectives and participation in value creation from stakeholders.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Goals are balanced by an alignment of incentives and interests.
{% endhint %}

### 3 - Bounded rationality / Unbounded rationality

The third agency assumption suggests that parties to a contract have limited or bounded rationality. This leads to a conservative approach to decision making where agents and principals fall back on their contingent knowledge and situation. Agents only do what is satisfactory to meet a contract rather than exploiting all economic outcomes.&#x20;

In contrast, permissionless blockchains are unbounded in the sense of being networks with open data, open source code and accessible information. Ideally this eases bounds on rationality making it possible with AI enhancements to optimize contracts and maximize economic performance.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual constraints on rationality are superseded with unbounded access to knowledge thus optimizing contracts and economic performance.
{% endhint %}

### 4 - Information asymmetry / Information symmetry

The fourth agency theory assumption is that there is an uneven distribution of intelligence between principals and agents. The agents hold more information than principals which inhibits the ability of the principals to monitor whether their interests are being served. The specialized knowledge of agents can act as a barrier to effective supervision and ambiguity in understanding by the principals.

In contrast, the transparency of blockchain ledgers and their algorithmic governance mitigate concerns of information asymmetry through decentralised consensus mechanisms. Members who use a permissionless blockchains maintain an identical copy of the ledger and information consensus is achieved by continuously synchronising all it's copies to ensure accuracy. All activities are traceable and visible across the entire network and can be reconstructed for audit at any time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Information symmetry is achieved through transparent access to the ledger and consensus mechanisms.
{% endhint %}

### 5 - Pre-eminence of efficiency / Smart contracts

The fifth assumption of agency theory is that ‘principals and agents will choose the most efficient contract’. Consquently any contract is driven by a cost-benefit analysis that seeks the least cost for the highest performance. This pre-eminence of efficiency limits human reflection and choice, reducing contracts to objective but superficial agreements.

<mark style="color:red;">The fifth assumption of agency theory is that ‘principals and agents will choose the most efficient contract’ (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Eisenhardt, 1989</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0285)<mark style="color:red;">: 69). This appetite for efficiency stemmed from Frederick W. Taylor’s time studies and scientific management view on the standardisation of work processes as a governance mechanism for improving the performance of individuals and groups (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Bendickson et al., 2016</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0105)<mark style="color:red;">). Thus, the contract between principals and agents is guided by a cost-benefit analysis (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Droege and Spiller, 2009</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0265)<mark style="color:red;">). Tasks are designed to be accomplished at the least cost or to generate the highest performance at a given cost (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Davis, 1985</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0215)<mark style="color:red;">). On one hand, principals are interested in generating greater profits while, on the other hand, workers seek shorter hours, better education, higher compensation and greater quality of life (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Bendickson et al., 2016</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0105)<mark style="color:red;">). Ostensibly, standardization in the pursuit of efficiency led to work becoming mundane for workers (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Klaw, 1979</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0465)<mark style="color:red;">). The efficiency goals of principals and agents were also at odds and often sparked conflict between principals and agents (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Wren and Bedeian, 2020</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0820)<mark style="color:red;">). Reverting to first principles, the prime retraction of the pre-eminence of efficiency assumption is</mark> [<mark style="color:red;">Eisenhardt (1989: 69)</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0285)<mark style="color:red;">'s articulation that ‘efficiency is not directly tested’ in the contractual process. Secondly, ‘efficiency poses a fundamental dilemma to members of the organisation in that it limits the range of human reflection and choice’ (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Davis, 1985</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0215)<mark style="color:red;">: 73). In particular, third, efficiency is a reified activity that reduces contracts into a phantom objectivity that conceals the fundamental relationship between people for their execution (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Lukács, 1972</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0530)<mark style="color:red;">). To stress this point,</mark> [<mark style="color:red;">Davis (1985: 75)</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0215) <mark style="color:red;">argued that when there is a pre-eminence of efficiency, the ‘dialectical process of understanding totality is lost and is replaced by an experience and a conceptual of mechanical causality’. Accordingly, as opposed to ‘efficient’ contracts that do not reflect the dynamic and human nature of relations between parties, blockchain alliances are governed by smart contracts. To resolve the performance tension between principals and agents, smart contracts are blockchain algorithms that automatically execute parties' agreements when predetermined conditions are met without incurring time loss (</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">Shahab and Allam, 2020</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0690)<mark style="color:red;">). Hence, there is an argument that rather than efficient cost-benefit analyses, smart contracts in blockchain alliances offer a more robust and less contentious basis to assess parties' actual performance, and in real-time too.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">To counter the assumption of pre-eminence of efficiency in principal-agent relationships, smart contracts are issued in blockchain alliances through algorithms that automatically execute transactions once programmed conditions have been met (</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">Shahab and Allam, 2020</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0690)<mark style="color:blue;">). First considered in 1993, smart contracts are programs deployed in a distributed network that can acquire external information and automatically update blockchain transactions (</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">Feng et al., 2019</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0305)<mark style="color:blue;">). The mechanism of smart contracts involves the deposit of assets into a contract by parties and subsequent redistribution of the assets among parties on the basis of the provisions of their inputs (</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">Baghery, 2019</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb1000)<mark style="color:blue;">). The automated nature of smart contracts means that no time is lost in reconciling errors that often result when principals and agents operate conventional systems (</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0205)<mark style="color:blue;">). Smart contracts also automate workflows and trigger successive actions without third-party involvement (</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">Lauslahti et al., 2017</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0480)<mark style="color:blue;">). When used in complex transactions as in blockchain alliances, smart contracts greatly improve transaction efficiency (</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">Feng et al., 2019</mark>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523001671#bb0305)<mark style="color:blue;">). This makes it superfluous for parties in an alliance to perform cost/benefit analyses.</mark>

### Mitigation of information asymmetry in a principal-agent relationship

#### ChatGPT 3

To mitigate the information asymmetry in a principal-agent relationship, the principal can employ various strategies and mechanisms. Here are some common strategies:

1. **Screening**: The principal can design screening mechanisms to gather information about the agent's characteristics, abilities, or effort level. This can involve the use of tests, interviews, or other assessments to gain insights into the agent's qualifications or suitability for the task.
2. **Incentive Alignment**: The principal can design incentive structures that align the agent's interests with their own. By structuring the contract to link the agent's compensation or rewards to specific performance metrics or outcomes, the principal can encourage the agent to reveal their private information and put forth their best effort.
3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The principal can implement monitoring mechanisms to observe the agent's actions and performance. This can involve regular reporting, progress updates, or periodic evaluations to ensure the agent is accountable and provide feedback on their performance.
4. **Reputation and Repeat Interactions**: The principal can consider the agent's reputation and past track record when selecting an agent. Agents with a good reputation or a history of trustworthy behavior are more likely to act in the principal's interest. Repeat interactions with the same agent also create incentives for the agent to maintain a good reputation and maintain a positive relationship with the principal.
5. **Auditing and Verification**: In some cases, the principal may need to conduct audits or verification procedures to validate the agent's actions or outputs. This can help ensure that the agent is adhering to the agreed-upon terms and meeting the required standards.
6. **Information Sharing**: The principal can provide the agent with relevant information or resources that can improve the agent's decision-making. By sharing information, the principal can reduce the information gap and improve the agent's ability to act in the principal's best interest.

It's worth noting that the strategies employed to mitigate information asymmetry will depend on the specific context and nature of the principal-agent relationship. The principal may need to assess the costs and benefits of each strategy and determine the most appropriate combination based on the level of information asymmetry and the desired outcomes.
