# Agency Theory & "Skin in the game"

## Skin in the game

The phrase "Skin in the game" originated in the 1980s and referred to the amount of an investment owned by a companies' management soliciting outside investment.&#x20;

The more that was owned by management, the equity stake, was seen as an indication of confidence or stability in the investment. A sign that the management were personally invested and therefore had "skin in the game".

## The phrase "Skin in the game"

Hence the phrase "skin in the game" has come to be seen as having a stake or personal investment that motivates decision making or participation.&#x20;

## Principal–agent problem

"Skin in the game" can be a problem when there is an excess of interest or investment that prejudices participation and/or decision-making. This tendency is called the "principal-agent problem".

The influence of those who have a large stake may be obscured resulting in a lack of transparency that disadvantages or manipulates those with smaller stakes.&#x20;

The principal-agent relationship may be between management (agent) and shareholders (principal), or elected officials (agent) and voters (principal), or brokers (agent) and buyers/sellers in a market (principal).

Where there is an asymmetry between agent and principal there will be concerns about moral hazard (exposure to risk) and conflict of interest (corruption).

## Blockchain agency theory <a href="#screen-reader-main-title" id="screen-reader-main-title"></a>

In the context of blockchain technologies the question arises of what is the nature of the principal-agent relationship in permissioned and/or permissionless chains. Where is agency in an environment that is ideally decentralized ?  Are there still parties (principal) who delegate work to others (agents) ?&#x20;

Governance takes the form of consensus algorithms that ideally regulate blockchain transactions. This permissionless state seeks to dispense with the agent-principal dependency.

Participation in a blockchain ecosystem can be characterized as a kind of strategic alliance between software developers, miners, stakepools, coin holders and other stakeholders that build tools and communities on the infrastructure.

Blockchain agency theory, as outlined in a recent paper, seeks to identify shifts in the principal-agent problem caused by disruptive technologies.&#x20;

## What principal–agent relationships have changed ?

The "Blockchain agency theory" paper identifies 7 assumptions that have informed analysis of the principal-agent problem and pairs these with 7 counter assumptions that may apply to the new blockchain paradigm.&#x20;

### Self-interest / Common Interests

The first assumption of Agency theory is that of self-interest. That agents are inclined to opportunistically reward themselves.&#x20;

Ideally a blockchain will moderate the self-interest of agents seeking to control principal participants. As long as the chain is sufficiently decentralized the common interest of an operational distributed ledger will prevail.&#x20;



Rather than the principal-agent relationship, the interactions in blockchain alliances take a many-to-many dimension and an ecosystem dynamic to co-evolve and co-create value in a mutual sequenc

## Blockchain agency theory assumptions

### Common Interests

A critical measure of a blockchain is how well it can moderate the self-interest of agents seeking to control principal participants. As long as the chain is sufficiently decentralized the common interest of an operational distributed ledger will prevail.&#x20;

### Congruent goals

### Unbounded rationality

### Information symmetry

### Smart contracts

### Mean risk

### Information availability

## Differences in Blockchain levels and use cases

The "Blockchain Agency Theory" paper does not investigate how different blockchain consensus paradigms, governance practices and use cases may alter the principal-agent relationship.

### Management (agent) and shareholders (principal)

A principal-agent relationship may persist in DAOs with smart contracts ...

### Elected officials (agent) and voters (principal)

Elections run on-chain may require agent intermediaries ...

### Brokers (agent) and buyers/sellers in a market (principal)

Financial instruments or products such as NFTs may require regulation and reporting ...
